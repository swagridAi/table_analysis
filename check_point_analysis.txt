Resumable Parameter Optimization System
I've built a comprehensive system that allows you to run extensive parameter optimization searches, pause them at any point, and resume exactly where you left off. This is especially useful for long-running grid searches that may need to be interrupted.
Key Components:
1. resumable_parameter_optimization.py - Core Resumable Framework
This script implements a checkpoint-based grid search that can be paused and resumed:

Checkpoint System: Automatically saves progress after each parameter evaluation
Graceful Interruption: Properly handles Ctrl+C and other signals to save state before exiting
Resume Logic: Automatically detects and loads previous progress when restarted
Progress Tracking: Provides detailed logging on completed and pending combinations

Usage:
bashCopypython resumable_parameter_optimization.py --output-dir optimization_results
If you need to interrupt (with Ctrl+C), you can later resume with:
bashCopypython resumable_parameter_optimization.py --output-dir optimization_results
2. checkpoint_manager.py - Checkpoint Analysis and Manipulation
This utility helps you analyze search progress and make informed decisions:

Status Reporting: Shows search completion percentage and current best parameters
Parameter Space Visualization: Creates plots showing explored vs. unexplored regions
Progress Analysis: Tracks quality improvement over iterations
Suggestion Generation: Proposes promising new parameter combinations to explore
Checkpoint Modification: Allows adding or removing specific combinations from the search

Usage:
bashCopy# View search status
python checkpoint_manager.py optimization_results/search_checkpoint.pkl --status

# Visualize parameter space and generate 5 new suggestions
python checkpoint_manager.py optimization_results/search_checkpoint.pkl --visualize --suggest 5
Key Features

Automatic Checkpointing:

Creates detailed checkpoints with complete search state
Minimizes data loss by saving after every few evaluations
Stores both completed results and pending combinations


Intelligent Resumption:

Seamlessly continues from the last saved state
Preserves all previous evaluation results
Maintains original parameter grid and optimization settings


Progress Analysis:

Visual exploration of the parameter space
Identification of promising regions for further exploration
Tracking of optimization progress over time


Adaptive Search:

Suggests new parameter combinations based on current results
Focuses exploration on high-performing regions
Fills gaps in parameter space coverage



This system gives you full control over long-running parameter searches, ensuring you never lose progress and can make intelligent decisions about where to focus your computational resources.
